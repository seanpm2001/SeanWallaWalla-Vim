# SeanWallaWalla-Vim (Redirect)

This project is a redirect page. The repository you are looking for is located here:

- [:octocat: `https://github.com/seanpm2001/Seanpm2001-Vim/`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Seanpm2001-Vim/)

## This is not the Vim you are looking for

### Although this logo is cool, this isn't the right place. I never used Vim before 2020, so it does not fall under the SeanWallaWalla category.
